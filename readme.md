first of all i have created a folder for the backend and the main purpose for this is to install the express in that folder.

first command that i have used here is 
1 npm init -y 
2 npm install express
3 i have done one change in the package.json file where in the script tag i have added  "dev": "nodemon server.js" so that i can use " npm run dev"
